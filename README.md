# An expo app creating on top of react native ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Steps to setup the project

1. Clone the repository locally

   ```

You will be able to see a working app after performing these steps. 

Every code is present in the **app** directory

## Approach taken to replicate the UI
   As I was a bit familiar with using react and have worked on couple of projects using HTML replicating the UI was not that difficult. I had to learn about the **core components of React native** to get started. Navigation part was a little bit tricky for me to catch up but after goinf through some tutorials and documentations I could finally find a solution for that.  I coudn't replicate the UI in ios devices because I didn't have the right set of facilities for that. I was enable to come up with a solution for the API as it was not free to use. I have implemented my own way of validating the user credentials for this prokject.

## Description on how the provided assets where used
   The provided assets made the development process smooth. I used the traditional method of creating the assets folder in the project directory and importing the images and icons accordingly.
